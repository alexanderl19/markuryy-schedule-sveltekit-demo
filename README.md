# markuryy-schedule-sveltekit-demo

A very basic example of implementing [a schedule app](https://github.com/markuryy/Schedule) in SvelteKit. This example contains the logic necessary for loading and downloading schedules from JSON files.

I've opted to use JSDoc comments over TypeScript to make this example more approachable.

## Developing

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), a drop in replacement for npm. <https://pnpm.io/installation>

Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install`), and start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
